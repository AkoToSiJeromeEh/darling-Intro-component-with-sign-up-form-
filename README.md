 🚀 FrontEnd-Mentor-Challenge 

Hi, it's me again, jeje! I'm dropping off a repository. This darling intro component includes a sign-up form with simple form validation. I used Yup to create it, as well as useState and props in this project. It also features some CSS animations and transitions. That's all, mabuhay!
